# SOC Analyst & Cybersecurity Portfolio

## 🚀 About This Repository  
This repo highlights my journey into cybersecurity through structured coursework and hands-on SOC-analyst labs. It shows how I translate security theory into practice — building, detecting, and responding to security incidents.

## 📚 Courses & Certifications

Here are the cybersecurity-focused courses I’ve completed:

- **Cisco – Introduction to Cybersecurity**  
  Built a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts: threat actors, malware, and how Security Operations Centers (SOCs) work.

- **Alison – Introduction to Cybersecurity**  
  High-level overview of cyber risk, defense strategies, and the importance of security controls.

- **Python Crash Course (Coursera)**  
  Learned Python from scratch and now use it to write scripts for parsing logs, automating simple tasks, and supporting my SOC labs.

- **(ISC)²: Certified in Cybersecurity (All Five Domains)**  
  Covered core cybersecurity domains:  
  1. Security Principles  
  2. Business Continuity & Incident Response  
  3. Access Control  
  4. Network Security  
  5. Security Operations :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
 
- **SOC Fundamentals – Let’s Defend**  
  Introduced me to how SOCs operate: alert types, monitoring logic, and response workflows.

- **SOC Analyst Essentials (Udemy)**  
  Focused on real SOC tasks: using SIEM, creating detection rules, investigating alerts, and responding to incidents.

## 🛠️ Projects & Labs

These hands-on labs put my course learnings into action:

### SOC Lab – Incident Detection & Response  
- **Goal:** Simulate real-world security incidents like brute-force attacks, phishing, and malware.  
- **Setup:** Virtual machines (Windows / Linux), log collection, SIEM tool for analysis.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Configure VMs & log forwarding  
  2. Generate malicious activities / attacks  
  3. Create dashboards and alert rules in SIEM  
  4. Investigate alerts, contain threats, remediate  
  5. Document everything in a structured **incident response runbook**  
- **Result:**  
  - Detection rules for different attack types  
  - Dashboards that visualize attack progression  
  - A playbook that simulates a real SOC response

### Detection Rule Engineering  
- **Goal:** Design and tune detection rules for suspicious behaviors.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Use SIEM query language (e.g., SPL)  
  - Write alerts for failed logins, privilege escalation, lateral movement  
  - Test rules against both benign and malicious logs  
  - Adjust to reduce false positives  
- **Outcome:**  
  - Reliable alerting rules  
  - Documentation of why each rule works and how it's tuned

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes

- Built multiple, practical detection rules that mirror real SOC scenarios.  
- Simulated a variety of cyber-attack behaviors.  
- Created dashboards to monitor alert timelines and severity.  
- Developed a runbook that can guide incident response in real scenarios.  
- Deepened my understanding of how logs, alerts, and playbooks work together to defend infrastructure.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Raw logs are powerful—but organizing and parsing them effectively is key.  
- It’s important to **fine-tune alerts**: too many false positives, and real threats get lost; too strict, and you miss them.  
- A well-documented **runbook or playbook** is essential for consistent, repeatable incident response.  
- Practical labs are invaluable: applying theory in a controlled environment makes everything click.

## 🔭 What’s Next (My Roadmap)

1. Expand the lab with more attack variations (e.g., ransomware, insider threat).  
2. Build more complex detection rules and correlation searches.  
3. Enhance my incident response documentation — refine playbooks for different attack types.  
4. Start automating simple responses (e.g., alert triage) to free up time for deeper investigations.
