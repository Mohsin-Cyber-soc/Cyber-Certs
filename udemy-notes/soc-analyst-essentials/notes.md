# SOC Analyst Essentials – Notes

## 1. Introduction to SOC  
- What a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is and its role in cybersecurity.  
- Key roles inside a SOC: analysts, threat hunters, incident responders.  
- Importance of a SOC for proactive threat detection and response.  

## 2. Networking & Security Fundamentals  
- Overview of **OSI & TCP/IP models** and how they relate to security.  
- Common network devices and security controls: firewalls, IDS/IPS, routers.  
- Network topologies (LAN, WAN) and their security implications.  
- Basics of Windows & Linux security: users, permissions, and system logging.  

## 3. Cyber Threats & Attack Vectors  
- Types of cyber threats: malware (viruses, ransomware), phishing, social engineering.  
- Attackers’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  
- Vulnerabilities vs. threats vs. weaknesses — how they differ and why they matter.  
- Common attack vectors: network-based attacks, host-based attacks, insider threats.  

## 4. SOC Architecture & Workflow  
- SOC maturity models and how SOC teams evolve.  
- SOC workflows: how monitoring → triage → investigation → response works in practice.  
- Key metrics and KPIs for SOC performance (e.g., mean time to detect/respond).  
- Common SOC challenges: alert fatigue, false positives, resource constraints.  

## 5. SIEM & Log Management  
- Definition and purpose of **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**.  
- Key log sources that SOCs monitor: endpoints, networks, servers, cloud.  
- SIEM architecture: log collection, parsing, normalization, correlation.  
- Log retention strategies and best practices for secure & efficient log storage.  

## 6. Incident Detection & Response  
- Detecting security events: how to read alerts and signals in your SIEM.  
- Triage process: determining real vs false alerts, prioritizing incidents.  
- Investigation strategies: building a timeline, gathering evidence, using threat intelligence.  
- Response planning: containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.  

## 7. Threat Intelligence  
- What **threat intelligence** is and why it's important in SOC operations.  
- Different types: strategic, tactical, operational threat intelligence.  
- How SOC analysts use threat intelligence to boost detection and response.  

## 8. Useful Tools & Commands  
- Important **Linux commands** (e.g., `grep`, `tcpdump`, `netstat`) for SOC analysis.  
- Common SIEM queries / search techniques.  
- Incident investigation checklist: key questions to ask during analysis.  
- Useful external resources: threat intel platforms, blogs, cheat sheets.

## 9. Personal Reflections & Lessons Learned  
- Concepts I found challenging or very insightful.  
- How these lessons changed my perspective on SOC operations.  
- How I plan to apply this knowledge: in labs, real-world projects, or on‑the-job.  
- My next steps: tools I want to learn, areas I want to deepen (e.g. threat hunting, SIEM tuning).
