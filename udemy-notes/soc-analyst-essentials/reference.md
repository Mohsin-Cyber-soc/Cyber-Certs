## ✅ Best Practices & Tips (From Course + Industry)

- Use **SIEM dashboards** to centralize and correlate logs: Focus on logs from endpoints, firewalls, and servers.  
- Regularly **review alerts**: Not all alerts are real incidents — prioritize them by risk.  
- Document **investigation workflows**: Maintain a simple playbook for triage → investigate → respond.  
- Learn **basic Linux commands**: Tools like `grep`, `netstat`, and `tcpdump` are very useful for SOC work.  
- Keep up with **career resources**: The course suggests network building, using LinkedIn, and tailoring your resume for SOC roles.
