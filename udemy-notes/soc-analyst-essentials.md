### Key Concepts and Modules

#### **Module 1: Introduction to a Security Operations Center (SOC)**
*   **What is a SOC?:** Understanding the purpose and function of a SOC in an organization.
*   **SOC Roles and Structure:** Differentiating between roles like Tier 1, Tier 2, and SOC managers, and how they work together.
*   **Core SOC Concepts:** Learning about the mission, processes, and people that make up an effective SOC team.

#### **Module 2: Cybersecurity Fundamentals**
*   **CIA Triad:** Reinforcing the principles of **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**.
*   **Threats and Vulnerabilities:** Understanding the difference between potential threats, system vulnerabilities, and overall risk.
*   **Types of Hackers:** Distinguishing between different threat actors, such as white-hat, black-hat, and script kiddies.
*   **Zero Trust Model:** Introduction to the concept of assuming no users or devices can be trusted by default.

#### **Module 3: Foundational Security Terms**
*   **Logs, Alerts, and Incidents:** Defining the key terms used in daily SOC operations.
*   **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) vs. Indicators of Attack (IoAs):** Understanding how to identify signs of a compromise versus signs of an active attack.
*   **Malware and Phishing:** Reviewing the most common cyber threats and how they impact security.
*   **Incident Escalation:** Learning the proper procedures for escalating an incident within the SOC.
*   **Playbooks and Runbooks:** Understanding how standardized procedures are used to guide incident response.

#### **Module 4: Essential SOC Tools and Technologies**
*   **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** The core tool for log management, correlation, and alerting.
*   **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Understanding how endpoint agents provide visibility and enable response actions.
*   **Threat Intelligence Platforms:** Learning how to use external threat data to enhance security monitoring.
*   **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):** Exploring how automation can streamline incident response workflows.
*   **Open-Source Tools:** Introduction to using open-source tools like the ELK stack and Splunk for a home lab.

#### **Module 5: Network Essentials for SOC Analysts**
*   **OSI and TCP/IP Models:** Reviewing the layers of the network stack to understand how data is transmitted.
*   **IP Addresses and Protocols:** Understanding the role of IP addresses, ports, and common protocols like **DNS** and **HTTP**.
*   **Network Security Devices:** Learning the function of firewalls, IDS/IPS, and web proxies.

#### **Module 6: Hands-On Labs and Incident Investigation**
*   **Log Analysis (Windows and Linux):** Practicing how to investigate logs from both Windows (Security, PowerShell) and Linux (`/var/log/auth.log`).
*   **Splunk Basics:** Getting hands-on with a SIEM to perform basic searches and investigate common attack scenarios.
*   **Phishing Analysis:** Performing basic analysis on phishing emails, including examining email headers.
*   **Threat Hunting:** Exploring techniques for proactively searching for threats that have bypassed security controls.
