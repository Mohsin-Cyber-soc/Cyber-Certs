## 🧰 Udemy — SOC Analyst Essentials: Cybersecurity & Operations

### Course Overview  
This Udemy course was foundational in my journey toward becoming a SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst. It combines core cybersecurity theory with hands-on SOC workflows — helping me understand both why SOCs exist and how analysts practically operate in real-world environments.

### What I Learned / Key Topics Covered  
- **SOC Fundamentals**: The structure of a Security Operations Center, the daily role of a SOC Analyst, and how SOC teams work together.  
- **Core Cybersecurity Tools**: SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response), IDS/IPS, and how these systems generate and manage security alerts.  
- **Log Management & Analysis**: Techniques for collecting, parsing, and analyzing logs. How alerts are created from raw data.  
- **Incident Detection & Response**: Lifecycle of a security incident (triage → investigation → remediation). How to respond to common threat types.  
- **Network Security Basics**: Understanding network traffic, proxy logs, firewalls, and how network data helps in identifying suspicious behavior.  
- **Cyber Threat Landscape**: Common threats like phishing, malware, and reconnaissance. How threat intelligence helps SOC analysts.  
- **Career Readiness**: Guidance on SOC Analyst career paths, typical team workflows, and what hiring managers look for.

### Practical Skills Gained  
- **Alert Triage & Investigation**: I practiced triaging alerts, investigating them, and determining their severity.  
- **SIEM Usage**: Built queries, dashboards, and detection rules to monitor for malicious or anomalous activity.  
- **Incident Playbook Design**: Created a simple playbook/runbook for handling incidents — document steps for containment, escalation, and resolution.  
- **Report Writing**: Wrote mock incident reports, summarizing findings, root causes, and remediation steps.

### Why This Matters for Employers  
- **Real-World Readiness**: The course emphasizes what SOC Analysts **actually do** day-to-day — not just theory.  
- **Tool Familiarity**: Hands-on experience with SIEM and log analysis reduces onboarding time.  
- **Incident Response Experience**: Having a playbook & investigation workflow shows I know how to *act* when there’s a real threat.  
- **Communication**: Report writing and triage demonstrate that I can clearly communicate technical findings — a critical skill in SOC roles.

### 📂 How This Fits Into My Portfolio  
Inside this GitHub repo:  
- I’ve included **notes and key takeaways** from the course in the `courses/udemy‑soc‑essentials/` folder.  
- I’ve built a **mini lab** in my `labs/` folder that mirrors what I learned: setting up alert rules, generating logs, and simulating simple incidents.  
- There’s an **“Incident Response Runbook”** I drafted based on course exercises and best practices.

### 🔭 Impact on My SOC Journey  
Completing this course gave me:  
1. Confidence in what SOC Analysts *do every day*.  
2. A solid baseline to build my own SOC‑style lab.  
3. Key skills that align with what hiring managers look for for **L1 SOC roles**.  
4. A foundation to take more advanced SOC courses, build detection engineering skills, and eventually automate part of the SOC workflow.
