# Introduction to Computer Network Security – Notes

## 1. What is Network Security  
- Network security involves protecting network infrastructure, devices, and data from unauthorized access or attacks.  
- It includes defense mechanisms against threats like malware, intrusion, and data interception.  

## 2. Threats to Network Security  
- Malware: viruses, worms, trojans threaten networked systems.  
- Phishing: social engineering tactic that can compromise credentials.  
- Network-based attacks: eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, DoS (Denial-of-Service).  

## 3. Authentication & Access Control  
- Authentication ensures only legitimate users / devices access systems.  
- Access control policies define what resources users or devices can reach.  
- Techniques: passwords, multi-factor authentication, encryption.

## 4. Security Mechanisms & Tools  
- Firewalls: filter traffic between networks based on rules.  
- Encryption: protects data in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized reading.  
- Monitoring & Logging: track suspicious activity through logs and alerts.

## 5. Risk Management & Policies  
- Risk assessment: identify, evaluate, and mitigate security risks.  
- Security policy: set of rules to guide how security is maintained in a network.  
- Incident response: how to respond when a security breach occurs.

## 6. Best Practices for Network Security  
- Use strong, unique credentials and change them periodically.  
- Keep software and firmware up to date to patch vulnerabilities.  
- Segment your network: separate sensitive systems using VLANs or subnets.  
- Regularly back up important data and test recovery plans.

## 7. Personal Reflections & Next Steps  
- These concepts reinforce the importance of security in every networked system.  
- I want to explore hands‑on network security labs: e.g., using virtual machines or simulation tools.  
- My next goal: take a more advanced cybersecurity course (e.g., network defense, ethical hacking) and build a small home lab.
