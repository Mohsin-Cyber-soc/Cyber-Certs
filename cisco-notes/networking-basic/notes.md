# Cisco Networking Basics – Notes

## 1. What Is a Network  
- A network is a set of devices (computers, routers, switches) that can communicate and share data. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Types of networks include LAN (local), WAN (wide-area), and other topologies. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## 2. OSI Model  
- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model has **7 layers**: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Each layer has a responsibility (e.g., Network layer handles logical addressing, Data Link handles MAC-level communication).

## 3. TCP/IP Protocols  
- The TCP/IP suite is the basis of real-world networking. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Key protocols:  
  - **IP** — handles addressing and routing of packets.  
  - **TCP** — ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery.  
  - **UDP** — used for faster, connectionless communication.  

## 4. Ethernet & Switching  
- Ethernet is a primary technology for wired LANs. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Switches operate at the Data Link layer: they forward frames using MAC addresses.  
- VLANs (Virtual LANs) allow segmenting a single physical network into multiple logical networks. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

## 5. IP Addressing & Subnetting  
- Devices use **IP addresses** to uniquely identify themselves on a network. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Subnetting is used to divide a network into smaller logical subnets to manage traffic and improve efficiency.

## 6. Basic Network Security  
- Firewalls help control traffic between networks by applying rules. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Authentication ensures that only authorized users/devices can access network resources.  
- Basic security practices are taught to help protect smaller network setups. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

## 7. Lab / Simulation Work  
- The course includes **Packet Tracer‑based simulation labs** to practice network setup, configuration, and troubleshooting. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- In labs, learners may simulate routers, switches, and network configurations, and test connectivity in a virtual environment. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

## 8. Reflections & Next Steps  
- Key topics that stood out: OSI model, VLANs, IP addressing.  
- Areas to improve: subnetting more deeply, simulating more complex topologies.  
- Plan: Use Packet Tracer regularly to build and test simple networks; then move to more advanced networking courses.
