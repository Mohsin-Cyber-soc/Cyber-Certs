# Cisco Networking Basics – Reference Guide

## 🔧 Key Concepts & Definitions

- **Network**: A system of interconnected devices to share data. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **OSI Model**: Seven‑layer model of network communication (Physical → Application). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Used for addressing and routing packets.  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable, ordered delivery.  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Unreliable but fast, used for things like video, DNS.  
- **Ethernet**: Technology for wired LANs. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Switch**: Network device that forwards data based on MAC addresses.  
- **VLAN (Virtual LAN)**: A way to segment networks on a switch logically.  
- **Firewall**: Controls traffic flow using security rules.  
- **Packet Tracer**: Simulation tool used to build and test network topologies. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

## ✅ Best Practices & Tips

- In Packet Tracer labs, **simulate real devices** (routers, switches) to better understand network behavior.  
- Use the OSI model as a reference when troubleshooting: identify which layer has issue.  
- Practice subnetting frequently — it's key to network design and configuration.  
- Always document your network configurations, even in simulation, to build good habits.  
- Use lab simulations to test security configurations (e.g., setting up a firewall, testing access rules).
