# Cisco Networking Basics

This folder contains my notes and reference material from the **Cisco Networking Basics** course (Networking Academy / “Networking from Scratch: Basics”). This course introduces the fundamentals of computer networking: how networks work, key protocols, and basic network infrastructure concepts — with practical lab/simulation work included.

## 📘 What’s Inside

- `notes.md` — Detailed summaries of each module, theory, and networking concepts  
- `reference.md` — Cheat sheets, definitions, and useful external resources  
- `Lab / Simulation Activities` — Hands-on tasks using network simulation tools (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer) to reinforce learning and practice real networking scenarios. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🧠 Key Skills & Concepts Covered

- Core networking fundamentals: devices, data flow, and how networks work
- The **OSI model**: understanding each of the 7 layers and their role in data transmission
- TCP/IP protocols (IP, TCP, UDP) and how they underpin modern networking 
- Ethernet technology, switching, and VLAN basics 
- IPv4 addressing and subnetting: how devices get addresses, and how to divide networks  
- Basic network security: firewalls, authentication, and device protection   
- Building and configuring small LANs — theory + simulated practice
- Hands-on simulation using **Cisco Packet Tracer**: building, testing, and troubleshooting network topologies

## ✅ My Learning Approach

- Completed all course modules (theory + simulation)  
- Took structured notes to capture both conceptual ideas and practical tasks  
- Built a reference guide to quickly revisit key terms and networking commands  
- Completed lab/simulation exercises using Packet Tracer (or similar) to solidify my understanding

## 🔍 Why This Matters to Employers

- Demonstrates a **solid foundation in networking** — critical for many network engineering or IT support roles  
- Shows practical experience: not just theory, but doing **simulated networking labs**  
- Indicates ability to work with Cisco‑style networking concepts and tools  
- Proves I can document and learn independently — a great signal for learning-oriented roles
