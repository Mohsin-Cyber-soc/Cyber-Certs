# Cisco Networking Basics

This folder contains my notes and reference material from the **Cisco Networking Basics** course (Networking Academy / “Networking from Scratch: Basics”). This course introduces the fundamentals of computer networking: how networks work, key protocols, and basic network infrastructure concepts — with practical lab/simulation work included.

## ✅ My Learning Approach

- Completed all course modules (theory + simulation)  
- Took structured notes to capture both conceptual ideas and practical tasks  
- Built a reference guide to quickly revisit key terms and networking commands  
- Completed lab/simulation exercises using Packet Tracer (or similar) to solidify my understanding

## 🔍 Why This Matters to Employers

- Demonstrates a **solid foundation in networking** — critical for many network engineering or IT support roles  
- Shows practical experience: not just theory, but doing **simulated networking labs**  
- Indicates ability to work with Cisco‑style networking concepts and tools  
- Proves I can document and learn independently — a great signal for learning-oriented roles
