## 🧪 Lab / Simulation Activities

- Hands‑on network simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer: build, configure and test network topologies without physical hardware. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Practice tasks include:  
  - Wiring and connecting routers and switches in a virtual LAN  
  - Applying IP addressing and sub‑netting in simulations  
  - Configuring basic switch operations and VLANs  
  - Simulating endpoint connectivity and testing network paths  
- These simulation tasks complement theory modules and help translate concepts into practical experience.
