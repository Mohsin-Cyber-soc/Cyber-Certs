# SOC Fundamentals – Notes

## 1. Introduction to SOC  
- Understanding what a Security Operations Center (SOC) is and its role in cybersecurity. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Why SOCs are needed: continuous monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## 2. SOC Types & Roles  
- Different SOC models: in‑house, virtual, co‑managed. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Key roles in a SOC: analysts, responders, and their responsibilities. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

## 3. SOC Analyst Responsibilities  
- How SOC analysts handle alerts: triage → investigation → escalation. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- The importance of process, communication, and prioritization.  

## 4. SIEM & Analyst Relationship  
- What SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- How analysts use SIEM to monitor, correlate, and investigate log data. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

## 5. Log Management  
- Collecting logs from different sources: endpoints, servers, network devices. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Parsing and analyzing logs to detect security-relevant events. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

## 6. EDR – Endpoint Detection & Response  
- What EDR is and its role in SOC: monitoring endpoint activity and telemetry. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- How to use EDR data to investigate security incidents.  

## 7. SOAR – Security Orchestration, Automation & Response  
- Definition and value of SOAR in a SOC. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Automating incident response workflows and reducing manual burden.  

## 8. Threat Intelligence Feed  
- What a threat intelligence feed is and how it supports SOC operations. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Using external intel to enrich alert context and prioritize investigations.  

## 9. Common Mistakes by SOC Analysts  
- Common pitfalls: alert fatigue, overdependence on tools, ignoring context. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Ways to avoid these mistakes: process optimization, documentation, continuous review.  

## 10. Personal Reflections & Next Steps  
- Which concepts felt most challenging and why.  
- How I plan to apply this knowledge in labs or real-world scenarios.  
- Future topics to explore (e.g., threat hunting, advanced SIEM, MITRE ATT&CK).
