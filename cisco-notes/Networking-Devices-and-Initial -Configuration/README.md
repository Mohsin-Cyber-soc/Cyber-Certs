# Cisco Networking Devices & Initial Configuration

This folder contains my notes and reference materials from the **Cisco Networking Devices & Initial Configuration** course (Cisco Networking Academy). This course covers intermediate networking topics with a strong focus on real device configuration using Cisco technologies.

---

## 📘 What’s Inside

- `notes.md` — Detailed summaries of each module, core networking concepts, and CLI configuration steps  
- `reference.md` — Cheat sheets for commands, device configuration guidance, and useful external resources  
- `Lab / Simulation Activities` — Packet Tracer–based labs for initial device setup, configuration, and troubleshooting   

---

## 🧠 Key Skills & Concepts Covered

- Hierarchical network design and foundational network architecture
- Cloud and virtualization technologies and their role in modern networks 
- Number systems (binary, hexadecimal) used in networking 
- Ethernet switching, MAC addressing, and switch behavior
- IPv4 / IPv6 packet structure, IP addressing, and subnetting
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and how devices resolve MAC addresses
- DHCP and DNS as IP addressing services 
- Transport layer protocols, including TCP and UDP (ports, reliability, flow control)  
- Cisco IOS CLI basics: navigating, viewing device info, and command structure
- Initial device configuration: configuring routers and switches, securing devices, default gateways, etc. 
- Using ICMP to test connectivity (Ping, Traceroute)

## ✅ My Learning Approach

- Completed all modules of the course, including theory and lab simulations  
- Took structured notes to capture both conceptual understanding and CLI commands  
- Documented configuration steps and common troubleshooting procedures  
- Reflected on how to apply this setup knowledge in real‑world or simulated environments

## 🔍 Why This Matters to Employers

- Shows that I can not only understand but *configure real* Cisco devices — a very valued skill  
- Demonstrates a bridge between theory and practical network implementation  
- Indicates a foundation in both modern concepts (cloud, virtualization) and traditional networking  
- Provides a portfolio of my structured learning, clear documentation, and configuration skills
