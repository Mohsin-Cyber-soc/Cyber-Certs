# Cisco Networking Devices & Initial Configuration – Notes

## 1. Network Design  
- Hierarchical network design: the three‑layer model (core, distribution, access).
- Importance of redundancy, fault tolerance, and scalable network architecture.

## 2. Cloud & Virtualization  
- Basics of cloud computing: what is cloud, and cloud service types.
- Role of virtualization in networks and how it affects device configuration. 

## 3. Number Systems  
- Binary number system (base-2) used in networking.
- Hexadecimal system (base-16) and converting between decimal, binary, and hex.  

## 4. Ethernet Switching  
- How Ethernet works in switched networks: Ethernet frames, MAC addresses.
- MAC address tables in switches: how switches forward traffic based on MAC. 

## 5. Network Layer  
- Characteristics of the network layer and its role in routing 
- Structure of IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

## 6. IPv4 Address Structure  
- Components of an IPv4 address: network vs host portions
- Using subnet masks to divide networks (subnetting).

## 7. Address Resolution (ARP)  
- How ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. 
- ARP table behavior in LANs. 

## 8. IP Addressing Services  
- DHCP: automatic assignment of IP addresses and configuration parameters.
- DNS: resolving domain names to IP addresses. 

## 9. Transport Layer  
- TCP: reliable transport, segmentation, flow control. 
- UDP: lightweight, connectionless transport.
- Port numbers and how transport protocols use them. 

## 10. Cisco IOS Command Line  
- Basic Cisco IOS CLI navigation: modes, prompt, and commands.
- Commands to view device information and verify configuration.

## 11. Initial Device Configuration  
- Basic switch / router setup: hostname, securing console and VTY lines. 
- Configuring IP addressing, default gateway, and network connectivity. 

## 12. ICMP and Connectivity Testing  
- ICMP messages (Ping, Traceroute) for testing network reachability. 
- Using Ping and Traceroute to verify and troubleshoot paths.

## Reflections & Next Steps  
- Topics that stood out: hierarchical network design, ARP, and initial Cisco device config.  
- Areas to improve: subnetting practice, building and securing networks in Packet Tracer.  
- My plan: build more Packet Tracer labs, configure real / virtual Cisco devices, and move toward advanced CCNA-level topics.
