# Cisco Networking Devices & Initial Configuration – Reference Guide

## Key Concepts & Definitions  
- Hierarchical Network Design (core / distribution / access)
- Virtualization — abstraction of hardware for multiple workloads 
- Number Systems: Binary & Hex for addressing / subnetting 
- MAC Address Table — switch logic for forwarding based on MAC 
- ARP — maps IP addresses to MAC addresses  
- DHCP — dynamic IP assignment protocol 
- DNS — resolves hostnames to IP addresses
- TCP — reliable transport protocol 
- UDP — faster, connectionless transport protocol 
- Cisco IOS CLI — command interface on Cisco devices  
- ICMP — protocol for Ping / Traceroute

## Best Practices & Tips  
- Use Packet Tracer to simulate and test configurations.  
- Practice converting numbers (binary / hex) regularly to strengthen understanding.  
- After configuration, always verify connectivity with **Ping** and **Traceroute**.  
- Document CLI commands you frequently use — helps you learn and revise.  
- Secure your devices early: set hostnames, console access, and apply basic security settings.
