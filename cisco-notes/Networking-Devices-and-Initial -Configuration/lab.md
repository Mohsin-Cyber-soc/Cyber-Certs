## 🧪 Lab / Simulation Activities

- **Packet Tracer – Initial Device Setup**  
  Configure routers and switches: set hostname, console / VTY login, and secure basic access.

- **Packet Tracer – IP Addressing & Subnetting**  
  Assign IPv4 addresses to devices, configure subnet masks, and test connectivity using **ping** and **traceroute**.

- **Packet Tracer – ARP Table Exploration**  
  Create a LAN, send ARP requests, and inspect ARP tables on devices to understand how IP‑to‑MAC mapping works.

- **Packet Tracer – DHCP & DNS Configuration**  
  Simulate a DHCP server to dynamically assign IPs, and configure DNS resolution for hostnames.

- **Packet Tracer – Transport Protocols (TCP / UDP)**  
  Build a simple network, then send TCP and UDP traffic. Observe differences in behavior (connection, reliability, speed).

- **Packet Tracer – Cisco IOS CLI Practice**  
  Use IOS CLI to navigate device modes, run `show` commands, and check the running configuration.

- **Packet Tracer – ICMP Connectivity Testing**  
  Use **ping** and **traceroute** (ICMP) to test network paths and troubleshoot basic reachability.

- **Packet Tracer – Small Network Design & Verification**  
  Build a small network topology using routers and switches, configure addressing, and verify end-to-end connectivity.
