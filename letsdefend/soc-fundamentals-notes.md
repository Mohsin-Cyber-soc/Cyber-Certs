### Reflection and Next Steps
The SOC Fundamentals course provided a theoretical framework for a career in cybersecurity. It helped to understand the bigger picture of a SOC's function.

The next step is to apply these concepts in hands-on labs on both LetsDefend and TryHackMe. This will help translate the theoretical knowledge of incident response and SIEM usage into practical skills. The goal is to document these labs and build a personal portfolio.
