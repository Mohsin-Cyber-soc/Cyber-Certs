# SOC Fundamentals – Notes

## 1. Introduction to SOC  
- Definition of a Security Operations Center (SOC) and its role in an organization.  
- Why SOCs are important: continuous monitoring, threat detection, response.  

## 2. SOC Types & Roles  
- Different SOC models: in‑house SOC, virtual SOC, co‑managed SOC. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Key roles: SOC analyst, incident responder, threat hunter, SOC manager. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## 3. SOC Analyst Responsibilities  
- Triage alerts, investigate incidents, escalate when needed. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Use of tools and data: understanding alerts, logs, endpoint telemetry.  

## 4. SIEM and Analyst Relationship  
- What is SIEM (Security Information & Event Management).  
- How SOC analysts use SIEM: monitoring, correlating alerts, investigation. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## 5. Log Management  
- Collecting logs from different sources (endpoints, network devices, servers).  
- Parsing and analysing logs for security monitoring and investigations. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

## 6. EDR – Endpoint Detection & Response  
- Purpose of EDR: monitoring, detecting threats on endpoints.  
- How EDR fits into SOC operations: endpoint telemetry, investigating endpoint events. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

## 7. SOAR – Security Orchestration, Automation & Response  
- What SOAR is and why it's relevant to SOCs: automating workflows, incident response. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

## 8. Threat Intelligence Feed  
- Using threat intelligence feeds: what they provide (indicators, reputation data).  
- How SOC analysts can incorporate feeds into detection and investigation. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

## 9. Common Mistakes SOC Analysts Make  
- Errors such as alert fatigue, over‑reliance on tools, not analysing context.  
- How to avoid these mistakes: process improvement, continuous learning, good documentation. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

## 10. Personal Reflections & Next Steps  
- Which concepts stood out / were new / challenging.  
- How I plan to apply what I learned (labs, home projects, further study).  
- Next topics I want to explore (e.g., threat hunting, advanced SIEM tuning, incident response labs).
