# ISC² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) – Notes

## Domain 1: Security Principles  
- **Information Assurance**  
  - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA triad)  
  - Authentication (including multi-factor), non-repudiation, privacy  
- **Risk Management**  
  - Risk identification, assessment, and treatment  
  - Risk priorities, risk tolerance  
- **Security Controls**  
  - Technical, administrative, and physical controls  
- **ISC² Code of Ethics**  
  - Professional conduct and responsibility  
- **Governance**  
  - Policies, procedures, standards, laws, and regulations  

## Domain 2: Business Continuity, DR & Incident Response  
- **Business Continuity (BC)**  
  - Definition, importance, and components  
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**  
  - Recovery strategies, planning, and testing  
- **Incident Response**  
  - Detection, response, and recovery phases  
  - Roles and responsibilities during security incidents  

## Domain 3: Access Controls Concepts  
- **Physical Access Controls**  
  - Badges, gate entry, CCTV, environmental security  
  - Monitoring and authorization  
- **Logical Access Controls**  
  - Principle of least privilege, separation of duties  
  - DAC, MAC, and RBAC models  

## Domain 4: Network Security  
- **Networking Fundamentals**  
  - OSI & TCP/IP models, IPv4 / IPv6, ports  
- **Network Threats & Attacks**  
  - DDoS, malware (viruses, worms, Trojans), man-in-the-middle, side-channel  
  - Detection: IDS, NIDS, HIDS  
  - Prevention: firewalls, antivirus, IPS  
- **Network Security Infrastructure**  
  - Segmentation: VLAN, DMZ, micro-segmentation  
  - Defense in depth, NAC, VPNs  
  - Cloud networking considerations  

## Domain 5: Security Operations  
- **Data Security**  
  - Encryption (symmetric, asymmetric, hashing)  
  - Data retention, classification, destruction  
- **Logging & Monitoring**  
  - Security event logging, event correlation, alerting  
- **System Hardening**  
  - Configuration baselines, patch management, update processes  
- **Security Policies**  
  - Acceptable Use Policy, Password Policy, BYOD, Change Management, Privacy  
- **Security Awareness Training**  
  - Social engineering, best practices, educating users  

## Reflections & Next Steps  
- These domains give me a solid, entry-level but real foundation in cybersecurity.  
- Strong areas: risk management, access control, and policies.  
- Topics I want to deepen: network architecture, cloud security, incident response planning.  
- Study plan: make flashcards, take domain quizzes, practice real-world scenarios, and take the CC exam.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

These projects provided a solid understanding of cybersecurity governance, risk management, and the distinction between IT and OT security.

The current focus is expanding this by writing sample code to automate some recommended controls, such as a script to audit user permissions as part of an access control review process.
