#Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Project (NIST Aligned)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** principles. A qualitative risk assessment was conducted for a fictional "Innovate Solutions" tech startup.

The main objective was to identify the startup's most significant cyber threats, prioritize them, and develop a clear plan using industry best practices. This involved the practical application of core security concepts.

**Key takeaway:** Security involves making informed business decisions based on risk tolerance, not just preventing hacks.

## 🚀 Skills & Technologies

This project showcases several skills relevant to employers:

*   **Risk Management:** A structured process was used to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks.
*   **Framework Application:** The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** was used for categorization and control recommendations.
*   **Documentation:** Professional reports and risk registers were created.
*   **Problem Solving:** Abstract threats were translated into concrete, actionable security controls (**MFA, Firewalls, Training**).

## 📁 Project Deliverables

All project reports are available in this repository:

*   **`Company-Profile.md`**: Context on the "business" and its assets.
*   **`Risk-Register-Matrix.xlsx`**: The spreadsheet used for scoring risks (Likelihood x Impact).
*   **`Risk-Assessment-Report-Final.pdf`**: The formal report ready for management review.
*   **`Security-Controls-Recommendation.pdf`**: The clear, actionable mitigation plan.

## 🧠 Methodology & Lessons Learned

A standard 5-step risk assessment process was used:

1.  **Identify Assets & Threats:** Prioritizing what to protect was crucial (customer data is most important).
2.  **Evaluate Risks:** Using a matrix helped standardize the risk-scoring process. This step demonstrated how to articulate the *business impact* of a technical vulnerability.
3.  **Determine Controls:** Security controls were applied based on the risks identified (e.g., implementing **MFA** if the risk is high due to weak passwords).
4.  **Record & Review:** Documentation is essential for auditing and continuous improvement.

## Next Steps

This project will be expanded by creating sample code for some of the recommended controls (e.g., a simple script to audit user permissions as part of the access control domain).
